            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented
         programming language that is designed to have as few 
         implementation dependencies as possible.
            Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that
         can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the
         underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar
         to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
         The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and
         runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
         compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most
         popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
         particularly for client server web applications, with a reported 9
         million developers.
             Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
         and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems'
         Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers,
         virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under
         proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications 
         of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies
         under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine,
         however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free
         open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost
         all Linux distributions.
              Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions
        of Java, due to unresolved security issues in older versions. Oracle advises its
        users to immediately transition to a supported version,
        such as one of the LTS versions (8, 11, 17).
