<h1> Web Development</h1>

<p>
    Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
    intranet (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static page 
    of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more 
    comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
    design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network
    security configuration, and e-commerce development.

    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web 
    developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
    organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
    related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
    be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There 
    are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
    developer.Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
    while back-end developers deal with the servers.

    Web developers now help to deliver applications as Web services which were traditionally only available as
    applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information
    and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud,
    Dropbox and Google Drive. These Web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations,
    instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.
