         <h1> Artificial intelligence (AI) </h1>
         <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed
            by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any
            system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.
            The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive
            skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". </p>

            <h1> Virtualization</h1>
            <p>In computing, virtualization or virtualisation (sometimes abbreviated v12n, a numeronym) is the act of creating
               a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices,
               and computer network resources. Virtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system 
               resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened. </p>

            <h1> Data Science</h1>
            <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract
               knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data,and apply knowledge and actionable insights
               from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.
               Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand
               and analyse actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
               statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge</p>
