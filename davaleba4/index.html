     <h1> Machine Learning </h1>
     <p>Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn',
        that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part
        of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as
        training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
        Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering,
        speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms
        to perform the needed tasks. </p>

        <h1> Cloud computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage 
           (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often
            have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing 
            relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically using a "pay-as-you-go" model which 
            can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware 
            users.Advocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or
            minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises 
            to get their applications up and running faster and that
            enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand. </p>

        <h1> Data structures and algorithms</h1>
        <p>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables
           efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the
           relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an
           algebraic structure about data.algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used
           to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Using human characteristics as 
           descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as "memory",
           "search" and "stimulus".</p>

        <h1>Network administration </h1>
        <p>Network administration primarily consists of, but is not  limited to, network monitoring, network management,
           and maintaining network quality and security. Network monitoring is essential to monitor unusual traffic patterns,
           the health of the network infrastructure, and devices connected to the network. It helps detect abnormal activity,
           network issues, or excessive bandwidth consumption early on and take preventative and remedial actions to uphold the
           network quality and security.Network management encompasses multiple administrative functions, including network planning,
            implementation, and configuration. It involves: </p>

        <h1>System administration </h1>
        <p>System administration is the field of work in which someone manages one or more systems, be they software, hardware,
           servers or workstations. Its goal is ensuring the systems are running efficiently and effectively.System administration
           is typically done by information technology experts for or within an organization. Their job is to ensure that all related
           computer systems and services keep working. The duties of a system administrator are wide-ranging, and vary from one organization
           to another. System administrators are usually charged with installing, supporting, and maintaining servers or other computer
           systems, and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems. Other duties may include scripting or light
           programming, project management for systems-related projects, supervising or training computer operators, and being the equivalent
           of a handyman for computer problems beyond the knowledge of technical support staff. </p>
