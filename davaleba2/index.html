                <p>  Our website is a freemium educational website for learning coding online. Developed in 2022, it derives its
                     name from the World Wide Web but is not affiliated with the W3C. We offer courses covering
                      all aspects of web development. It is run by Refsnes Data in Georgia. </p>
                <p>  Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet 
                    (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web
                    applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
                     development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
                      client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                    Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
                    writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier
                     and available with basic technical skills.
